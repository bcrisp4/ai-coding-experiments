# ai-coding-experiments

A sandbox repository for AI coding agents to work autonomously on experiments, exercises, and projects.

## Purpose

This repository gives AI coding agents complete freedom to explore and create in an isolated environment. Agents are expected to handle large tasks autonomously with minimal user input, enabling an asynchronous coding workflow.

## Structure

This is a monolithic repo. Each project lives in its own subdirectory at the root level, with a README explaining what it does.

## Projects

- [opamp-control-plane](./opamp-control-plane) - OpAMP GitOps control plane for managing OpenTelemetry Collector configurations across Kubernetes and VMs using Git as the source of truth
